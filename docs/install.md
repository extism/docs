The `extism` [CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli) is used to manage [Extism](https://github.com/extism/extism) installations and execute plugins from the command-line. In order to run Extism, your system must be able to locate the `libextism.so` (on Linux), `extism.dll` (on Windows) or `libextism.dylib` (on macos).

> **Note:** If you are using the [Rust Host SDK](/docs/integrate-into-your-codebase/rust-host-sdk), this is not the case, and can use Extism as a [crate dependency](https://crates.io/crates/extism) in your `Cargo.toml`. 

---

The following instructions will walk you through how to install the Extism CLI, and then the installation of the shared library which a [Host SDK](/docs/concepts/host-sdk) will look for automatically.

## Install the Extism CLI

Using go: <small><em>(recommended)</em></small>

```sh
go install github.com/extism/cli/extism@latest
```

There are also releases available on Github: https://github.com/extism/cli/releases

---

## Using the Extism CLI

The most common use-case is to to install Extism from Github releases, and then install the library and header file into the installation prefix of your choice. The default prefix is `/usr/local`, so libraries will be installed to `/usr/local/lib` and the header will be installed to `/usr/local/include`.

```sh
sudo extism lib install
```

:::note
`sudo` may use a different path than your user. If so, you may need to tell sudo to use the PATH defined for your user with: `sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" extism lib install`
:::
#### Installing the latest from git

It's also possible to install the latest build from the `main` git branch:

```sh
sudo extism lib install --version git
```

#### Overriding install location

Pass the `--prefix` argument a path on disk where `extism` CLI will install the system files:

```sh
extism lib install --prefix ~/.local
```
