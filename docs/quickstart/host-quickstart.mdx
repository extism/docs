# Quickstart

The following is a minimal guide to running an Extism plug-in in your language
and platform of choice. This document should get you from `0` to `"Hello, World!"`
as quickly as possible.


## Choose A Language

In Extism parlance, your normal (non-wasm) application is known as the "host".
We offer a variety of libraries, which we call "Host SDKs", to help you embed
Extism plug-ins into your application.

First choose the language of your application:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript" default>

### Install the Dependency

The module is hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@extism/extism).
Put the `@extism/extism` dependency in your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install @extism/extism --save
```

:::note Supported Runtimes
This library is also compatible with [Browsers, Deno, and Bun](https://github.com/extism/js-sdk#compatibility)
but this guide will assume we're running in node.js.
:::

### Import the library and load a plug-in

We suggest you copy paste the following code here into a node.js shell:

:::note Count Vowels Plugin
`count_vowels.wasm` is an example plugin that counts vowels. It was written in Rust, but can
be written in any of the supported PDK languages.
:::

```javascript title=repl.js
const createPlugin = require("@extism/extism")

const plugin = await createPlugin(
    'https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm',
    { useWasi: true }
);
```

### Call an export function

Let's call the "count_vowels" export function on the plugin. This counts the number
of vowels in the string we pass in and returns a JSON encoded result.

```javascript title=repl.js
let out = await plugin.call("count_vowels", "Hello, World!");
console.log(out.text())
// => '{"count":3,"total":3,"vowels":"aeiouAEIOU"}'
```

### Documentation

Congrats! You just ran your first Extism plug-in. To learn more about what this
javascript library can do, see the [js-sdk README](https://github.com/extism/js-sdk#readme) and [reference docs](https://extism.github.io/js-sdk/).

### Install the Dependency

Install via go get:

```bash
go get github.com/extism/go-sdk
```

### Import the library and load a plug-in

Let's now load a plug-in in Go.

:::note Count Vowels Plugin
`count_vowels.wasm` is an example plugin that counts vowels. It was written in Rust, but can
be written in any of the supported PDK languages.
:::

Copy paste this into a main function in `main.go`:

```go title=main.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/extism/go-sdk"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	manifest := extism.Manifest{
		Wasm: []extism.Wasm{
			extism.WasmUrl{
				Url: "https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm",
			},
		},
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	config := extism.PluginConfig{}
	plugin, err := extism.NewPlugin(ctx, manifest, config, []extism.HostFunction{})

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to initialize plugin: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

```

### Call an export function

Let's call the "count_vowels" export function on the plugin. This counts the number
of vowels in the string we pass in and returns a JSON encoded result.

Copy-paste this code to the end of your main func:

```go title=main.go
func main() {
    // ...

	data := []byte("Hello, World!")
	exit, out, err := plugin.Call("count_vowels", data)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(int(exit))
	}

	response := string(out)
	fmt.Println(response)
}
```

Run the program:

```bash
$ go run main.go
# => {"count":3,"total":3,"vowels":"aeiouAEIOU"}
```

:::

```java title=Main.java
import org.extism.sdk.manifest.Manifest;
import org.extism.sdk.wasm.UrlWasmSource;
import org.extism.sdk.Plugin;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    var url = "https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm";
    var manifest = new Manifest(List.of(UrlWasmSource.fromUrl(url)));
    var plugin = new Plugin(manifest, false, null);
}
```

### Call an export function

Let's call the "count_vowels" export function on the plugin. This counts the number
of vowels in the string we pass in and returns a JSON encoded result.

```

### Call an export function

Let's call the "count_vowels" export function on the plugin. This counts the number
of vowels in the string we pass in and returns a JSON encoded result.

Here we add a `print_plugin_output` function and the remainder of the main implementation:

```c title=main.c
void print_plugin_output(ExtismPlugin *plugin, int32_t rc) {
  if (rc != EXTISM_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s\n", extism_plugin_error(plugin));

  }

  size_t outlen = extism_plugin_output_length(plugin);
  const uint8_t *out = extism_plugin_output_data(plugin);
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, out, outlen);
}

int main(void) {
  // ...

  const char *input = "Hello, world!";
  print_plugin_output(plugin, extism_plugin_call(plugin, "count_vowels",

### Install the Dependency

For this library, you need to install the Extism Runtime. You can [download the shared object directly from a release](https://github.com/extism/extism/releases) or use the [Extism CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli) to install it:

```bash
sudo extism lib install --version git

#=> Fetching ...
#=> Copying libextism.dylib to /usr/local/lib/libextism.dylib
#=> Copying extism.h to /usr/local/include/extism.h
```

### Import the library and load a plug-in

Let's now load a plug-in from Haskell!

Add `extism` to your [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) file:

```haskell title=example.cabal
executable example
  main-is: bin/Main.hs
  build-depends: extism
```

In your Haskell project:

:::note Count Vowels Plugin
`count_vowels.wasm` is an example plugin that counts vowels. It was written in Rust, but can
be written in any of the supported PDK languages.
:::

```haskell title=bin/Main.hs
module Main where
import Extism

main = do
  let wasm = wasmURL "GET" "https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm"
  plugin <- unwrap <$> newPlugin (manifest [wasm]) [] True
```

### Call an export function

Let's call the "count_vowels" export function on the plugin. This counts the number
of vowels in the string we pass in and returns a JSON encoded result.

```haskell title=bin/Main.hs
  res <- unwrap <$> call plugin "count_vowels" "Hello, world!"
  putStrLn res
```

```bash
cabal exec example 
# => {"count":3,"total":3,"vowels":"aeiouAEIOU"}
```
