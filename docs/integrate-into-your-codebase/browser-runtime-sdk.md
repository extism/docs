# Using the Browser Runtime SDK

### 1. Install the Javascript library

Install via `npm`:
```sh
npm install @extism/runtime-browser
```

### 2. Include the library and use the APIs

```javascript title=app.js
// import or require (depending on your module system)
import { ExtismContext } from "@extism/runtime-browser"

// You can load raw wasm bytes from file, request, etc
const manifest = { wasm: [{ data: "..." }] };

// Or you can pass in a path to a wasm file
// this is our count-vowels example plugin
const manifest = { wasm: [{ path: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extism/extism/main/wasm/code.wasm" }] };

const ctx = new ExtismContext();
const plugin = await ctx.newPlugin(manifest);

// call the function 'count_vowels' defined in the wasm module
let output = await plugin.call('count_vowels', 'this is a test');

conosole.log(JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(output)));
```
