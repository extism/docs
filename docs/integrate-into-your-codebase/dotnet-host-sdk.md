# Using the .NET Host SDK

:::caution Check your installation

For Mac and Linux users, please be sure you've [installed Extism](/docs/install) before continuing with this guide.
This step is not required for Windows users as the native package is bundled with the Extism runtime DLL.

:::

### 1. Install the NuGet Package

Install via [NuGet](https://nuget.org):

```sh
dotnet add package Extism.Sdk
```

:::note Windows Support

We provide a [native package for Windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Extism.runtime.win-x64).
You can install with:

```
dotnet add package Extism.runtime.win-64
```
:::

### 2. Import the library and use the APIs

:::note Count Vowels Plugin
`code.wasm` in this example is our example plugin that counts vowels. If you want to run this, download it first and set the path:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extism/extism/main/wasm/code.wasm > code.wasm
```
:::

```csharp title=Program.cs
using Extism.Sdk.Native;
using System.Text;

var context = new Context();
var wasm = await File.ReadAllBytesAsync("./code.wasm");
using var plugin = context.CreatePlugin(wasm, withWasi: true);

var output = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(
    plugin.CallFunction("count_vowels", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello World!"))
);
Console.WriteLine(output); // prints {"count": 3}
```
