# Host SDKs

In Extism parlance, we call the application that your plug-ins extend the _host_. e.g: in VS Code, if the extensions are the _plug-ins_ then the editor itself is the _host_. 

The library you use to manage and run plugins in the host is called a _host SDK_.

See the [Integrate into your codebase](/docs/category/integrate-into-your-codebase) section to find a Host SDK in your language.
