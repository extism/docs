Extism plugins are WebAssembly modules, and as such, need to be tested within a
WebAssembly runtime in order to truly verify how they behave and perform.

To do this, a new test runner CLI must be used. This tool is called `xtp`. To
install `xtp`, you can run:

```sh
curl https://static.dylibso.com/cli/install.sh | sudo sh
```

> NOTE: Dylibso is the core maintainer and creator of Extism. You can find more
> information about the company at https://dylibso.com, and if you have any
> questions about `xtp` or Extism, please reach us at support@dylibso.com or in
> the [Extism Discord](https://extism.org/discord). The `xtp` CLI is a free
> developer tool, part of a larger product, which you can learn about
> [here](https://getxtp.com) - but you can use `xtp` CLI without using the XTP
> platform.

Once you have `xtp`, you can now run unit tests that call your Extism plugins
and assert various things about them, such as outputs for given inputs, plugin
state, or timing the performance of plugin function calls. To do this, we
provide test harness libraries to create these unit tests for you to run with
`xtp`.

To begin testing your Extism plugins, use any of the following to write tests
in:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-js)
- [Rust](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-rust)
- [Go](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go)
- [Zig](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-zig)

Within each of these repositories, you will find detailed instructions on how to
write, compile, and run tests. It's important to note, that while these
libraries are available in JS, Rust, Go, and Zig, you can use them to test Extism
plugins which were written in **any** of the
[Extism PDK languages](/docs/concepts/pdk).

## Testing a Plugin with Host Functions 

When your plugins need to make calls to Host Functions, the obvious question introduced is _"who is implementing the host functions?"_. 

To solve for this, we provide an optional `--mock-host` argument to the `xtp` CLI when you execute tests. Here's an end-to-end example, split into 3 different Wasm projects:
- a KV datastore (`kvhost`), exporting `kv_read` and `kv_write` functions (these act in place of _real_ host functions and are imported by the plugin)
- an Extism plugin (`kvplugin`), which interacts with the KV datastore via host function imports
- an XTP test plugin (`kvtest`), which verifies the behavior of the Extism plugin

> all of the following code can be found in full here: [`xtp-test-go/examples`](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go/tree/main/examples)

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kvhost" label="Mock Host Functions" default>

The `kvhost` project is a simple key-value store that exports `kv_read` and `kv_write` functions. These functions are used by the `kvplugin` 
project to read and write key-value pairs. When this project is compiled, it will produce a Wasm file that can be used as a host for the `kvplugin` 
project, passed as the `--mock-host` argument to the `xtp` CLI.

```go title="kvhost/main.go"
package main

import (
    // to simulate Host Functions, use the PDK to manage host/guest memory.
    pdk "github.com/extism/go-pdk"
)

// this is our in-memory KV store (e.g. a mock database)
var kv map[string]string = make(map[string]string)

// This export will be made available to the plugin as an import function
//go:export kv_read
func kv_read(key uint64) uint64 {
    // find the memory block that contains the key, read the bytes, and look up the 
    // coreesponding value in the KV store
    keyMem := pdk.FindMemory(key)
    k := string(keyMem.ReadBytes())
    // if the entry is not found, return 0
    v, ok := kv[k]
    if !ok {
        return 0
    }

    // allocate a new memory block for the value, write the value bytes, and return the offset
    valMem := pdk.AllocateString(v)
    return valMem.Offset()
}

// This export will be made available to the plugin as an import function
//go:export kv_write
func kv_write(key uint64, value uint64) {
    // find the memory block that contains the key and value, read their bytes, 
    // and store the key-value pair in the KV store
    keyMem := pdk.FindMemory(key)
    valueMem := pdk.FindMemory(value)
    k := string(keyMem.ReadBytes())
    v := string(valueMem.ReadBytes())
    kv[k] = v
}

func main() {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kvplugin" label="Plugin using Host Functions">

The `kvplugin` project is an Extism plugin that interacts with the KV datastore via host function 
imports. This plugin reads and writes key-value pairs and stores them in the plugin's state. We will 
verify this behavior using the `kvtest` project in the next tab.

```go title=kvplugin/main.go
package main

import (
    // this is a normal Extism plugin, so we import the PDK
	pdk "github.com/extism/go-pdk"
)

// the `kv_read` and `kv_write` functions below are imported from the host,
// (which we exported in the previous tab)

//go:wasmimport extism:host/user kv_read
func kv_read(key uint64) uint64

//go:wasmimport extism:host/user kv_write
func kv_write(key uint64, value uint64)

//go:export run
func run() int32 {
    // allocate a key and value to write to the KV store
	key := pdk.AllocateString("key")
	value := pdk.AllocateString("value")
	kv_write(key.Offset(), value.Offset())

    // immediately read the key back from the KV store, just to verify that it was written
	readVal := kv_read(key.Offset())
	if readVal != 0 {
        // if we found a value, read it from memory and append it to the plugin's state
        // (we'll test the state output in the `kvtest` project)
		readValMem := pdk.FindMemory(readVal)
		varVal := pdk.GetVar("key")
        // grow the var state in the plugin by appending the read value
		pdk.SetVar("key", append(varVal, readValMem.ReadBytes()...))
	} else {
		pdk.SetVar("key", []byte(""))
	}

    // return the plugin's state as the output so we can test it in the `kvtest` project
	pdk.Output(pdk.GetVar("key"))
	return 0
}

func main() {}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kvtest" label="XTP Test Plugin">

The `kvtest` project is an XTP test plugin that verifies the behavior of the `kvplugin` project. When we 
run this test, we will pass the `kvhost` project as the host, so that the `kvplugin` project can interact 
with the KV store we simulate in the `kvhost` project.

```go title=kvtest/main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

    // import the test harness library
	xtptest "github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go"
)

//go:export test
func test() int32 {
    // call the `run` function in the `kvplugin` project, & verify the output
	output := xtptest.CallString("run", nil)
	xtptest.AssertEq("initial call to 'run' returns the correct value", output, "value")

    // call the `run` function in the `kvplugin` project 10 times, & verify the output each time
	xtptest.Group("multiple kv read/write calls produce correct state", func() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			output := xtptest.CallString("run", nil)
			expected := strings.Repeat("value", i+1)
			msg := fmt.Sprintf("repeat call to 'run' returns the correct value: %s", expected)
			xtptest.AssertEq(msg, output, expected)
		}
	})

	return 0
}

func main() {}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After compiling each of these Go projects to Wasm, you can run the test using the `xtp` CLI, 
and pass the `--mock-host` argument to specify the host Wasm file, to stitch all the pieces together:

```sh
xtp plugin test kvplugin.wasm --with kvtest.wasm --mock-host kvhost.wasm
```

You should see output like this: 

```sh
ðŸ§ª Testing plugin.wasm

PASS ...... initial call to 'run' returns the correct value

ðŸ“¦ Group: multiple kv read/write calls produce correct state

## Mocking input data to plugin test calls

Configure your test with dynamic input provided by a `xtp` CLI param or `xtp.toml` file. Read runtime-provided input that mocks the actual input when a plugin is called: 

> Note: this is available in each of the [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-js), [Rust](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-rust), [Go](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go), & [Zig](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-zig) test harness libraries.

```go
//go:export test
func test() int32 {
    // use the MockInputBytes() function to read the input data provided by the test runner
    // (there are variations of this function in other xtp-test libraries)
	notEmpty := xtptest.CallString("count_vowels", xtptest.MockInputBytes())
	xtptest.AssertNe("with mock, not empty", notEmpty, "")
  // ...
}
```

### Providing mock input data

There are two ways to provide input data to the plugin test calls: 
- `xtp` CLI, using `--mock-input-data` or `--mock-input-file`
- `xtp.toml` file

### Using the `xtp` CLI

CLI supports args `--mock-input-data` and `--mock-input-file` to pass text or load a file.

e.g 
```sh
xtp plugin test plugin.wasm --with test.wasm --mock-input-data "this is my mock input data"
# or a path to a file for --mock-input-file
```

### Using `xtp.toml`

`xtp.toml` supports syntax such as: 

```toml
# path or url locating the wasm plugin to test
bin = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extism/extism/main/wasm/code.wasm"

[[test]]
# label this test something recognizable to see in CLI output
name = "basic"
# build the test wasm module, is run before the test
build = "cd examples/countvowels && tinygo build -o test.wasm -target wasi test.go"
# the wasm module to use as the test
with = "examples/countvowels/test.wasm"
# provide mock input data to the plugin test call, returned to a 'MockInput' type of function call
mock_input = { data = "this is my mock input data" }

[[test]]
name = "basic - file input"
build = "cd examples/countvowels && tinygo build -o test.wasm -target wasi test.go"
with = "examples/countvowels/test.wasm"
# load mock input data from a file instead of inline
mock_input = { file = "examples/countvowels/test.go" }
```

> (see examples used in [`examples/countvowels`](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go/blob/main/examples/countvowels/test.go))

## Overriding `xtp.toml` location

When running `xtp plugin test`, if `xtp.toml` is present in the current directory, it will be used to configure the test. The location of the file can be overridden using `--path`:

```sh
xtp plugin test --path tests/countvowels
```

## Usage in tests

The various XTP libraries provide convenient functions like `MockInput()`, `MockInputString()`, and `MockInputBytes()` to dynamically read input from the host, mocked out by the supported options above.
