Extism plugins are WebAssembly modules, and as such, need to be tested within a
WebAssembly runtime in order to truly verify how they behave and perform.

To do this, a new test runner CLI must be used. This tool is called `xtp`. To
install `xtp`, you can run:

```sh
curl https://static.dylibso.com/cli/install.sh | sudo sh
```

> NOTE: Dylibso is the core maintainer and creator of Extism. You can find more
> information about the company at https://dylibso.com, and if you have any
> questions about `xtp` or Extism, please reach us at support@dylibso.com or in
> the [Extism Discord](https://extism.org/discord). The `xtp` CLI is a free
> developer tool, part of a larger product, which you can learn about
> [here](https://getxtp.com) - but you can use `xtp` CLI without using the XTP
> platform.

Once you have `xtp`, you can now run unit tests that call your Extism plugins
and assert various things about them, such as outputs for given inputs, plugin
state, or timing the performance of plugin function calls. To do this, we
provide test harness libraries to create these unit tests for you to run with
`xtp`.

To begin testing your Extism plugins, use any of the following to write tests
in:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-js)
- [Rust](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-rust)
- [Go](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-test-go)

Within each of these repositories, you will find detailed instructions on how to
write, compile, and run tests. It's important to note, that while these
libraries are available in JS, Rust, and Go, you can use them to test Extism
plugins which were written in **any** of the
[Extism PDK languages](/docs/concepts/pdk).

For more context about this tool, the test harness libraries, and why we created
them, please read the announcement blog post at:
