# GameBox Blog Part II

In [Part I](/blog/extending-fly-io-distributed-game-system-part-1), we wrote a special [Elixir GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) that allows us to replace any GenServer in our Elixir apps with an Extism Plug-in. Our goal was to build a version of [this turn-based game system](https://fly.io/blog/building-a-distributed-turn-based-game-system-in-elixir/) that allows users of the platform to create and upload their own games.

Today we’re announcing the result, GameBox!

## GameBox

[GameBox](https://gamebox.fly.dev/) is hosted on [Fly.io](https://gamebox.fly.dev/) and you can start creating and uploading games today. You can write your game in any language where we have [PDK support](https://extism.org/docs/category/write-a-plug-in). So far we’ve written games in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Rust. And we have people attempting games in Zig and Go.

If you want to see GameBox in action, we played a live game of Trivia with the entire audience at [Wasm/IO in Barcelona](https://wasmio.tech/) this year. See the first few minutes of Steve’s talk here:

## How it works

The primary technical concept behind GameBox is, as lifted from the previous post, about replacing a key GenServer implementation with an Extism plug-in. Like its inspiration, GameBox is built with the [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework and the GenServer we targeted to extend is [LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#content).  The LiveView module has a pretty simple API:

- [LiveView.mount/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:mount/3) is called when a user connects to the module
- [LiveView.handle_info/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:handle_event/3) is called when an event is triggered in the client
- [LiveView.render/1](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:render/1) is called when the system needs to re-render the client

It's important to learn about [LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) to understand how the system works and how a game can be created.

### LiveView LifeCycle

`mount/3` is hand coded for the most part, but `handle_info/3` and `render/1` are proxied to the game plug-in to handle. You can think of the game as a single state machine. Events come in through `handle_info` and may or may not mutate the state. When the system needs to be redrawn, `render` is called and the game outputs some HTML. 

Events are defined and triggered on the client using [Phoenix bindings](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-bindings). The game programmer doesn’t need to code up a javascript front end, they just need to use the HTML bindings provided by Phoenix. For example, in tic tac toe, a button looks like this:

```html
<button
  phx-click="cell-clicked"
  phx-value-cell="3"
  class="cell">
</button>
```

When the user clicks this button, an event is sent to the handle_info callback of this shape:

```json

{
  "player_id": "benjamin",
  "event_name": "cell-clicked",
  "value": {
  	"cell": "3"
  }
}
```

The game logic can interpret this message and mutate the state of the board by placing the player’s character (`X` or `O`) at cell index `3`.

### Game Logic

As mentioned before, the game developer creates a game by satisfying these callbacks. We provide an interface, a number of functions, that the game must export to
plug-in to the GameBox system. Thanks to Extism, this interface can be implemented in any language we support. In the next post we will look at how to make a game as a plug-in.
