We’ve seen a few people try to create Extism plug-ins that make use of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt). The simplest way you can accomplish this is to use Extism’s built-in HTTP host function. A more advanced option would be to create your own [host function](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/host-functions). 

Let’s go the first route and create the simplest possible plug-in that utilizes ChatGPT. We’ll do this in Rust, but the same is possible from our other plug-in languages.

## Project Setup

First let’s initialize our plugin:

```bash
mkdir chatgpt-plugin
cd chatgpt-plugin
cargo init --lib
cargo add serde serde_json extism-pdk
```

Now tell cargo we wish to build a shared library by putting this in `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[lib]
crate_type = ["cdylib"]
```

## Writing lib.rs

First we import the code we need into `lib.rs`:

```rust
use std::str::from_utf8;
use extism_pdk::*;
use serde::{Deserialize};
use serde_json::json;
```

Then let’s create some structs for the response body. We’re just putting what we need for this example. See [the completion docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/response-format) for the whole response.

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ChatMessage {
    content: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ChatChoice {
    message: ChatMessage,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ChatResult {
    choices: Vec<ChatChoice>,
}
```

Now let’s write our code. We’re going to skip error handling and edge cases as an exercise for the user:

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn call_chat_gpt(input: String) -> FnResult<String> {
		// put your API key here:
    let api_key = "sk-<put-your-api-key-here>";
    let req = HttpRequest::new("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")
        .with_header("Authorization", format!("Bearer {}", api_key))
        .with_header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .with_method("POST");

    let req_body = json!({
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": input,
            }
        ],
    });

    let res = http::request::<String>(&req, Some(req_body.to_string()))?;
    let body = res.body();
    let body = from_utf8(&body)?;
    let body: ChatResult = serde_json::from_str(body)?;

    Ok(body.choices[0].message.content.clone())
}
```

<aside>
💡 Storing API keys unencrypted is a bad idea for a production system. For secrets there are a couple options:

1. You can use [plug-in configs](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/configuration) and the [runtime function](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/configuration) to update them. If you do this you’ll probably want to assume all configs are secrets and take extra care not to leak configs across customers.
2. You provide some kind of host function for the plug-in programmer to fetch and decrypt their secrets from a secret provider / manager.

## Compiling and Running

We can compile and run this plug-in like we always do:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

<aside>
💡 Note we do not need a `wasi` target since we are using Extism’s HTTP host function

</aside>

Now we can use the `extism` cli to test:

```bash
extism call \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/chatgpt_plugin.wasm \
  call_chat_gpt \
  --input="Please write me a haiku about Wasm"

Wasm code compiled,
Runs in browser, fast and light,
Web apps flourish bright.
```
